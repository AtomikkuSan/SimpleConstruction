###  minor housekeeping 
     - patch dusting (mostly removing construction dust (comments))
     - ELControlReferenceSC (ghostparts) has had its description updated to include the corrected text: "For those times where you need to switch control references quickly, such as doing a ventral landing. At the flick of an action button, this device will override your avionics and become your new fore and aft, with suitable indicators highlighting when active. At a second flick of the action button, the device will remove the override and the previous control reference will be active once again."
